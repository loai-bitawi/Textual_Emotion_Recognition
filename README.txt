This project is an AI Agent that is pretrained on tweets and its classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative), 
then it can interact with the environment by receiving a text and predicts the class of the text based on 4 ML models.
Then, the agent submits the 4 classes to a fuzzy voter that decides the %of positiveness or negativeness in the text.
(The voter returns a value from 0 to 1 instead of class value) 

the file "AI Text Emotion Recognition.pdf" contains details about the project
